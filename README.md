# Todo
Yes, it's's the ubiquitous **Todo** app. The core functionality of this right now is:

- Add items
- Toggle completion with left-click
- Delete item with right-click
- List is persistent, via local storage

### To come...

- Responsive design
- Ability to edit items
- Ability to reorder items
- Dark mode
- Accessibility audit

(I'm working on a React version of this, more or less at the same time... You can see the progress of _that_ version [here](https://github.com/mtripney/todo-react).)
